# FastFood Online Ordering System

Introduction

Welcome to the FastFood Online Ordering System! This project is designed to provide local takeaway shops with a cost-effective, independent online presence. Our goal is to empower small businesses by offering a platform that minimizes dependency on large food portals like Just Eat, Uber Eats, and Deliveroo, which often charge high commissions and impose unfair policies.

Problem Statement

Many small local takeaway shops rely heavily on food portals to reach their customers online. While these platforms offer convenience and visibility, they come with significant drawbacks:

1. High Commission Fees: Small businesses pay substantial commissions on each order, which can severely impact their profitability.

2. Unfair Policies: Many food portals enforce strict and often unfair policies that can be detrimental to small businesses. For example, businesses are often required to align their pricing with the portal's policies, preventing them from offering cheaper prices on their local menus compared to what is listed on platforms like Just Eat.

3. Dependency: Over time, businesses become increasingly dependent on these platforms, losing control over their customer relationships and online presence.

# My Solution

The FastFood Online Ordering System aims to solve these problems by providing an independent platform that allows small businesses to manage their online orders directly. Key benefits of our solution include:

1. Lower Costs: By eliminating the middleman, businesses can save on commission fees.

2. Control and Flexibility: Businesses have full control over their online presence, policies, and customer interactions.

3. Enhanced Customer Relationship: Direct interaction with customers helps build stronger relationships and loyalty.

# Technologies Used

This project leverages modern web technologies to create a robust, scalable, and efficient online ordering system:

- React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Vite: A next-generation front-end tool for faster and leaner development.

- Apollo Server: A fully-featured GraphQL server for building high-performance APIs.

- GraphQL: A query language for your API, providing a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.

- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development productivity and code quality.

- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and performance.

- Prisma: A next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js and TypeScript that helps in managing the database schema and queries.

- Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.
